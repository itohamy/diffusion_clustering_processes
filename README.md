# Diffusion Clustering Processes

In this work we extend their reach 
to posterior inference over structured domains,
showing that they excel at probabilistic clustering,  
We present a neural architecture
that, given as input any number of data items, 
outputs a probabilistic cluster label of each item via a diffusion process of continuous latent variables. The model is trained supervisedly with labeled clustered datasets. 
Unlike all previous models performing this task, 
our architecture preserves explicitly the exchangeability of 
the clustering posterior.
